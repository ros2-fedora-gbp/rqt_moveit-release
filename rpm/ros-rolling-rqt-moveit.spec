either running, existing or published: Node: /move_group Parameter:

monitored. Published &quot;names&quot; are ignored. [sensor_msgs/PointCloud,
sensor_msgs/PointCloud2, sensor_msgs/Image, sensor_msgs/CameraInfo] Since this
package is not made by the MoveIt! development team (although with assistance
from the them), please post issue reports to the designated tracker (not
